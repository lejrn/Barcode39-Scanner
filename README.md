# Barcode39-Scanner
Very basic implementation of barcode 39 scanner module, based on Intel 8085 architecture

# Goal
As a team, we designed and implemented a verilog module that gets sequence of Black and White encoded barcode (with 1's and 0's), and decodes it into its character value

# Examples
The sequence 001010110100 is pictured as (wide or narrow) Black (B) and White (W) as BBWBWBWWBWBB.
Every character is encoded with its correspondent sequence.
BBWBWBWWBWBB = 'A'

# Language
Verilog

# Design Diagram
First design as described here:

(Note: final design was slightly different)

# Special Thanks
Big thanks to my colleague and friend, Gal Eshel, who teamed up with me for this project. Never could have I asked for a better companion to work with and learn from. Also, we're fun at weddings.
